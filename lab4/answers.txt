Part 1: 
    (i) what is the TF-IDF measure
        - The TF-IDF is a measure for how important a word is in a document. This is done by multiplying how many times a word appears in a document with the inverse document frequency of the word across a set of documents. Words which appear in a sole document are measured more valuable for that document than words which appear in multiple other documents. 
   
    (ii) how to use TF-IDF for:
        - Document Similiarity
            -  Calculate the cosine similiarity between two document vectors. The direction of the angle is what's important. A small angle means less difference and more similarity. Orthogonal angles means the documents are pretty much not related and angles around 180 degrees means opposite document similarity. 
        Classifying text
            - Multinomiyal naive bayes can be used to classify text. A predictive model is created by calculating the TF-IDF matrix and then passing it to the multinomiyal naive bayes classifier to train a model.
